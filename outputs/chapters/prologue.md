# Prologue – The Doorway's Whisper

Jack Morris stepped out of his car, the autumn wind nipping at his neck as he surveyed the dense shadows that loomed over the brick apartment building. Decaying foliage lay scattered on the ground, remnants of a once-vibrant garden, now abandoned to the creeping chill. As he approached the entrance, the heavy wooden door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit lobby that felt untouched by time. 

Art Grayson, the building’s superintendent, stood behind the counter, his thin frame shrouded in an overcoat that seemed two sizes too big. His glasses slipped down the bridge of his nose, and he peered at Jack with a mix of curiosity and skepticism.

“Welcome,” Art said, his voice gravelly, as if it had been pulled from the depths of a long-forgotten well. “First time here?”

“Yes, just moved in,” Jack replied, trying to sound upbeat despite the gnawing unease that settled in his stomach. The lobby exuded a stagnant warmth, dulled by years of neglect. As he took in the faded wallpaper and the flickering fluorescent lights, the air grew thick with an unsettling energy, as if the walls themselves were whispering unspoken secrets.

Art offered a slight nod, putting on a forced smile. “Good place, if you can get used to the quirks. You’ll meet the neighbors soon enough.” He gestured towards the hallway, which extended into shadows that stretched far beyond the reach of the flickering light.

Jack set down his few boxes, acutely aware of the odd behavior of the few residents he glimpsed in the hallway—flashes of movement behind closed doors and the cautious peering of curious faces. He pondered what Art meant by quirks but dismissed the thought, attributing it to the natural tension of a new environment.

As he began unpacking, the echo of footsteps and muted conversations drifted through the walls, like whispers from the past. The building felt alive, its creaks and groans wrapping around him like a cold fog, but he shook off the sensation. After all, he was just adjusting to a new place, nothing more.

Hours later, a knock interrupted his thoughts. He opened the door to find Evie, a nurse who seemed both warm and wary. Her auburn hair fell messily about her shoulders, and her expression suggested she was battling a racing mind. 

“Hey there,” she said, shifting nervously on her feet. “I wanted to check in on you—make sure you’re settling in okay.”

“Thanks, I appreciate that,” Jack replied, sensing the urgency in her eyes. 

Evie glanced over her shoulder as if expecting something to emerge from the shadows. Her voice dropped to a whisper, “Just a word of caution. This place… it’s got its oddities. Residents here like to keep things quiet. There are stories.”

“What kind of stories?” he asked, intrigued yet doubtful, eager to recast the building in a more mundane light.

She hesitated. “They say sometimes you can hear things in the walls. Strange noises. Talk to Mrs. Holloway if you dare. But be careful, Jack. Not everything here is what it seems.” 

Her warning hung thick in the air, lingering like smoke. Jack scratched his head, trying to laugh her concerns off, but a gnawing apprehension crept into his heart. The building was old; noises were all but a certainty. The chill on the back of his neck flared to life. “Thanks for the heads-up, but I’ll be alright.”

Evie offered a small, tight smile before excusing herself, her figure retreating into the long corridor. Left to his thoughts, Jack returned to unpacking, but the weight of her warning clung to him. The following days were layered with an increasing sense of strangeness. He heard occasional wall-scraping noises, like fingernails dragged across rough panels, but Art assured him it was nothing more than the building settling.

Then came Mrs. Holloway, a frail yet fierce woman, her silver hair pulled into a tight bun. She tapped insistently on Jack's door, her intense eyes piercing through the space he created for himself. “You’re the new tenant. I thought I’d pay a visit.”

Jack invited her in, her presence filling the room with an unexpected warmth. She sat on the edge of the chair, her hands trembling slightly. “You’ve heard the stories, yes?”

“Stories?” Jack echoed, increasingly unnerved. 

She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. “About the carpenter who vanished. Last tenant on the third floor. He was a good man. One day, just… disappeared.” Her eyes sparkled with a blend of fear and intrigue, as if reliving the tale warped her reality into that of a sinister fairy tale. “Folks say he found something in the walls, something he wasn’t meant to. I think it found him back.”

Uncomfortable, Jack tried to brush off her words. “Well, I’m not planning on going anywhere anytime soon,” he said with a slight laugh, but the sincerity fell flat. He could feel the looming specter of her warning like a cold breath on the back of his neck.

Mrs. Holloway took a sharp breath, her voice shifting to a haunting tone. “Watch for the doorway, young man. It whispers at night. If you heed its call, you may not like what you find.”

Jack smiled uneasily, dismissing her words to his growing unease. Yet, as nights turned to weeks, whispers indeed crept into his dreams, waking him in the cold hours of the night. The scraping noises intensified, wrapping around him like a sinister lullaby. 

And then there was Bernie Wilkes, an enigmatic resident with a penchant for the cryptic. One day, he ambushed Jack in the hallway, eyes wide with urgency. “Have you seen it?” he asked, almost breathlessly.

“Seen what?” Jack replied, the sinking feeling growing heavier.

“The door,” Bernie murmured, his voice dropping conspiratorially. “They say it’s still there, waiting for someone to find it. Just... don’t go looking for it. Trust me, that way lies madness.”

Tension buzzed between them, and Jack felt the heaviness of their shared fears. The door—an unknown entity drifting just out of sight, yet somehow woven into the fabric of the building. Jack’s heart quickened as he pondered the weight of those words, a deepening sense of foreboding settling into his bones. 

The whispers from the walls grew louder, wrapping around him in a tight embrace, as if the building itself breathed in tandem with his fleeting hope. He stood at the threshold of something dark and alluring, caught between hesitation and the incessant pull of the unspeakable.
