# Chapter 04 – The Door's Secrets

  
Jack leaned against the peeling wall of the old building, frustration pulsing at his temples like a rising tide. Bernie had approached him earlier that afternoon, eyes wide, intense. “The door lets you out when it wants,” he had warned, arms flailing slightly for emphasis. The words were cryptic, echoing in Jack’s mind, yet they settled uncomfortably in his gut, stirring the crosshairs of his instinctual unease. He brushed the thought away, shaking his head as if it might dislodge the notion entirely. 

“What does that even mean?” Jack mumbled to himself, annoyed. He glanced around the room—deteriorating plaster and splintering wood reminded him of his own internal decay. The renovation had started as an escape, a chance to rebuild and reclaim a lost past. Yet with every layer of paint he stripped, every nail he pulled, he unearthed more memories than he cared to confront. “Does he think this is some sort of game?” Jack left the room, frustration spilling into his movements.

The hall was dim, a consistent gloom that emphasized his isolation. Jack strolled down the line of doors, stopping at the one housing Bernie's warning. A cracked panel revealed a thin sliver of darkness that felt alive, pulsing softly as if breathing. He pressed his ear against it, straining to hear any hint of a secret. Silence. Just the buzz of old fluorescent lights and the distant thrum of the wind. 

Jack lowered his head, pulling away, but he turned back once more. “The door lets you out when it wants.” What if it wanted out? What if the missing were trapped behind it? A shiver skated down his spine, clawing at the edges of rational thought as he walked away, the heaviness in his chest deepening.

  
Jack ran his hand through his hair and took a deep breath. He had to seek answers, and Daniel Keene felt like a possible oasis in this desert of despair. If anyone would know about the door, it would be the reclusive resident. As he reached Daniel's flat, he felt a spike of trepidation. The door appeared weathered, its hinges rusted and warped. Jack rapped on it, and after what felt like an eternity, the wood creaked open just enough for Daniel's gaunt figure to emerge.

“Jack Morris,” Daniel rasped, his voice like crushed gravel. “Come to talk about the door?”

“Yeah, I’m here for…” Jack faltered, unsure how to phrase his inquiry without sounding insane. “I’ve heard things. About the disappearances.”

Daniel's eyes narrowed, the shadows in his face deepening. “I have something that might interest you.” He stepped back, gesturing for Jack to enter the dimly lit apartment. The air clung to him like a damp blanket, filled with the scents of old paper and something sharp—a hint of decay.

Jack settled onto a rickety chair while Daniel moved to a dusty acoustic player in the corner. “I recorded something,” he mumbled. The tape began to spool, and static filled the space. Jack strained to hear, breath hitching in surprise as the whispers danced out, twisting through the silence like tendrils of smoke. 

“Jack… help… Jack…” The disembodied voices pleaded, their tones laced with desperation and urgency. Goosebumps cascaded over Jack’s arms; he felt as if the whispers were calling directly to him, surfacing fears he had buried long ago. 

“Who is that?” Jack demanded, leaning forward. 

“Lost souls,” Daniel replied cryptically, his eyes glinting with understanding. “They are the ones who didn’t leave when the door opened.” The weight of his words hung in the air like an unspoken spell, deepening Jack’s sinking feeling of dread. 

  
After the conversation with Daniel, Jack roamed the building’s dimly lit corridors, his thoughts a tangled web. The haunting whispers echoed in his mind, and it felt as though he were navigating through a maze, each turn darkened by uncertainty. His heart quickened when he spotted Art at the end of the hallway, his figure hunched over, whispering into shadows.

“What are you saying?” Jack called out, approaching his colleague with a simmering agitation. 

Art turned, eyes wide and blinking rapidly. “Nothing. Just… vents.” He waved a hand dismissively, but Jack caught the glimmer of something more—a flash of fear or comprehension.

“Don’t lie to me. I heard you.” Jack stepped closer, intent, forcing Art into the tight corridor illuminated by flickering bulbs. “What about 'Cracks remember'? What does that mean?”

Art shook his head, the facade of nonchalance cracking. “Just… just talking out loud. I was thinking about the structure of the building.”

Jack crossed his arms, firm. “Stop dodging me. You know it’s more than just walls and wood. What does it remember?”

For a moment, Art hesitated, the tension palpable. Then he scoffed, brushing Jack off. “You’re overthinking this. It’s old—things wear out, and what’s lost is lost. The door doesn’t keep anything but dust.” His words dripped with worn-out bravado, and Jack felt a new wave of frustration surge through him.

“Try again, Art. This isn’t just about the building—it’s about what’s happening. People are disappearing!” Jack pressed. But Art turned, mumbling something incoherent, dismissal spilling from his lips. This only deepened Jack's confusion and anger. There was a truth lurking in the shadows, but no one was willing to acknowledge it.

  
The disquiet grew within Jack as he wandered through the building's hallways, every door seeming to whisper allure and warning. When he reached the end of the corridor, he stumbled upon an inexplicable sight. Walter, his colleague, stepped up to the mysterious door. Jack’s breath caught in his throat as he watched Walter slide through the threshold without hesitation, his body momentarily vanishing into the darkness beyond.

“Walter!” Jack yelled, panic launching through him. He approached the door but found himself halted just before it, aware of the warm air brushing against his face as if the door were inviting him in, too. He hesitated. 

“Did anyone see that?” he called over his shoulder, seeking acknowledgment from passing workers. But they ignored him, hurrying on, preoccupied by their own struggles, the weight of the building's presence too heavy for them to lift their heads. Jack felt the heat of isolation settle upon him, thick and suffocating.

Panic clapped around him, and he turned back to the door, heart racing. He pressed a hand against its mismatched surface, his fingertips tingling, sensing something beyond. A heartbeat? A whisper? The world around him faded, and the door felt alive, vibrating with secrets that he had no hope of grasping.

No one cared that Walter had just disappeared, and that thought snaked through his mind. “Why doesn’t anyone else see this?” he muttered, but the building swallowed his words whole. He retreated, dread coiling tighter and tighter, an invisible vice hard on his chest. What if he was the only one who could see the truth? 

He turned back toward the stairs, urgency pushing him to leave the foreboding corridor behind. Something loomed over him, darker than the space around him; he had to escape before it pulled him in, too.

  
Jack stumbled out of the building and into the haunting chill of the evening air, the sun lingering like a dying ember on the horizon. As his senses adjusted, a damning realization struck him: he couldn’t stop thinking about the door. Every cryptic word, every haunting memory washed over him like a wave, but he still had no idea where they would pull him.

He crossed paths with Evie, who stood on the street corner, her expression a mask of concern. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” she remarked, and Jack managed a weak smile that felt more like a grimace. 

“Walter disappeared,” he confessed, fighting to keep the tremor from his voice. “He just… went through that door. And no one cares.”

Evie's brow furrowed, genuine worry igniting in her eyes. “The door?” she repeated, the shock lifting the corners of her mouth. “People talk about it, you know. The folks who went in… some say they’re gone for good.”

“Why does it feel like no one wants to talk about it?” Jack felt desperation clawing at him, each word a futile plea. 

“Fear,” she whispered, glancing around as if the shadows were listening. “It’s easier to ignore than to face. You can’t trust the door. I’ve heard things. Things that make my skin crawl.”

“What things?” Jack pressed, the words tumbling over one another.

“Just… things that can’t be explained,” Evie replied, her gaze drifting to the ground. “Some went in and never came back. The door holds secrets, Jack—terrible secrets.” 

The weight of her words clung to him like iron shackles, fear mingling with curiosity in an unsettling dance. The ominous allure of the door beckoned from the building’s shadows, and despite the dread threading through him, a part of him also felt a compelling urge to step back inside.

  
That night, sleep evaded Jack’s grasp. Shadows gathered in his mind, swirling in nebulous shapes, bringing with them voices that whispered warnings so soft he strained to hear them. The door loomed before him, stretching across his thoughts, the chilling promise of knowledge tantalizingly close yet heart-stoppingly distant.

The next morning, he returned to the building, hesitantly approaching the door once again. Guilt washed over him; he should be doing everything in his power to keep others away, to warn them of the secrets that lay coiling behind that dark threshold. Instead, here he was, drawn as if by an unseen force. 

“Just a quick look,” Jack muttered to himself, though he recognized the lie. There was an undeniable compulsion urging him forward, tugging at his heartstrings against his will. Jack’s fingers grazed the rough wood, and for a moment, he hesitated.

The door didn’t creak as he opened it, its silence unnerving. The air felt different—charged with possibility and dread. Jack stepped inside, adrenaline racing through him. The whispered voices began anew, swelling like a chorus in his mind, echoing the names of those who had vanished. 

“Jack… help me…” It was there—Walter’s voice—a plea that sent chills racing down his spine. Heart pounding, Jack took a step deeper into the void, squeezing his eyes shut against the tremors of fear tightening his chest. “Where are you?” he managed to call out, his voice quivering through the darkness.

Moments passed, or perhaps eons; time felt like a thin thread unraveling into the abyss. But something tangible pulled him deeper, more substantial than shadow. He caught glimpses of brief light as whispers beckoned him, weaving into a tapestry of connection that felt familiar yet foreign.

“No!” a voice jolted him away, awe replaced with disbelief. He stumbled backward, almost colliding with the doorframe. Jack’s breath hitched; he looked behind him, convinced this was some cruel trick of his mind, but the door remained ajar, untouched. 

  
“Jack?” It was Walter’s voice, but it echoed as though from far away. “You need to listen. You have to understand.” The voice reverberated in the stillness. Jack clenched his fists, swallowing his fear as he stumbled forward, desperate to find the source.

“Where are you?” Jack shouted, his heart pounding in time with the thrumming pulse of the air. The silence that followed felt deafening, thick with unspoken truths. 

“Behind the panels… it remembers.” 

The realization hit him hard. Jack's mind raced; Art’s words twisted around his thoughts, binding and unraveling them as he recalled the remnants of the building’s history. “Cracks remember…” 

A shiver cascaded down Jack’s spine, and fear turned into urgency. If the door had secrets, maybe he could unearth them. “I’m coming!” he shouted, conviction rallying within. He rushed through the dim space, frantically searching for cracks—physical evidence of lost stories, forgotten echoes of building lives.

Jack traced the room’s panels, pressing his palms against walls, feeling for vibrations beneath the surface, something more than mere decay. He was losing time—each second a reminder of those who had vanished, and with the urgency, the grotesque weight of the memories began to blur the lines of reality.

“Walter, I’m here!” Jack’s voice trembled, straining against the shadows that felt alive around him. The door trembled slightly, flickers of light pushing through the cracks. For a brief moment, Jack believed he could reach them. 

He found it—the panel that felt out of place. It shuddered under his fingers as he pressed against it, surprised by the softness beneath the crumbling facade. Was it a pulse? Perhaps a heartbeat? Desperate now, he pulled at the edge, prying it open.

  
The sudden rush of air snatched the breath from Jack's lungs. Like a tidal wave, the whispers surged, a cacophony of voices reaching out from the darkness. He felt trapped, caught in a web spun from fear and longing—a yearning to understand. 

“Help us… help us….” The voices grew louder, piercing through the haze of confusion surrounding him, urging him to listen—to act. Jack’s heart raced as he forced the panel open wider, revealing more of what lay beyond the surface.

What erupted from within was a flood of memories—the echoes of those lost to the door, trapped amidst its impenetrable grasp. Their faces swirled in his mind, blending into a collage of despair, recalling every sorrow that lay hidden behind the walls of the building.

“Walter!” Jack pleaded, desperate to break through the illusions surrounding him. “I can hear you!” 

The darkness enveloped him, pressing tightly. Each breath felt like it might be his last, yet still, Jack pushed forward, fighting against the weight of unseen forces anchoring him down.

Then he saw Walter. His face was ghostly pale, fear etched into every line. “You need to let them go, Jack,” he urged, voice trembling with urgency. “They’re in pain. You can’t set them free by staying here. Come back with me.” 

The intensity of the moment strengthened something within him—an understanding that transcended fear. Jack staggered backward, tearing himself from the visions’ grasp. “I won’t let this chain me!” he shouted, ripping the panel fully free, exposing the emptiness.

The echoes quieted, the air still. Jack blinked against the gripping darkness, emerging from the overwhelming silence with newfound clarity. He recognized the truth now—something deep within the building’s bones didn’t want its secrets laid bare. 

“We are not mere memories,” a voice whispered, not from Walter, but something darker. "This door will swallow you whole if you let it.” 

Jack felt the weight of that truth settle on him, a dense fog of realization as he stumbled back out into the light. The door loomed behind him, imposing and silent, yet he knew—he would return to confront its secrets, to free those trapped within its corners. If he didn’t, the weight of lost souls would crush him, drawing him into the abyss forever.

Determination burned in Jack’s veins. He wouldn't be lost among the whispers. Not now.
