# Chapter 10 – The Cycle Continues

  
David stood in the dimly lit corridor, shadows swirling as he recalled Evie’s words. The haunting truths wrapped around him, tight as a noose. He had sensed the peculiar weight of the building ever since he arrived, a sinister undercurrent surging just beneath the surface. In the silence that followed Evie's revelation, his thoughts converged on Bernie, an old worker whose cryptic warnings still echoed in his mind.

“*The door lets you out when it wants,*” Bernie had said, and David clenched his fists, frustration boiling inside him. What did it mean? He paced slowly, attempting to map the twisted architecture of the place, its hallways like arteries—throbbing, alive, and dangerously unpredictable. The flickering lights overhead pulsed, their failing brightness mirroring his agitation. How could he trust a door that took more than it gave?

As David turned a corner, he passed a series of closed doors, each one an enigma shrouded in secrecy. He recalled stories of missing workers like dark stains on the canvas of his new life. With a deep breath, he made his way toward the small break room at the end of the corridor, where he remembered seeing Daniel Keene. If anyone knew the labyrinthine truths behind this place, it was Daniel. 

When he entered, the room was cluttered with tools, the aroma of rust and sweat thick in the air. Daniel hunched over a battered old tape recorder, its worn surface a testament to its numerous tales. David felt a shiver of anticipation mixed with apprehension. This could help him understand the shadows lurking inside the building, but it could also plunge him deeper into the darkness of its mysteries.

  
“Daniel, can you play that tape you had?” David asked, struggling to keep the tremor out of his voice. 

Daniel looked up, his brow furrowed, the deep lines etched into his face revealing years of wrestling with sanity. “You sure about that?” he replied cautiously. “It’s a strange one.”

David nodded, bracing himself. Curiosity clawed at him, driving the urge to confront the unknown. Daniel pressed play, and out of the aging machine came whispers, soft but insistent. “David… help me, David…” The name echoed, a chorus of voices weaving around him. Each repetition felt tangible, as though the shadows from which they sprang coiled closer.

“*What does it mean?*” David asked, his voice barely above a murmur.

Daniel frowned. “It’s just... people who vanished. Their voices live on, trapped in the walls.” He glanced toward the door, fear flickering in his eyes. 

David listened intently as the voices mingled with phantoms of his past. They called for him. He felt their want, a seductive pull that teetered on the edge of despair. Were these the remnants of those who had come before him? The sinister tapestry of the building felt more woven into his very being with each passing second. 

“Did you ever find the people behind those whispers?” David asked, his heart racing. 

“No one searches anymore. They just disappear,” Daniel replied, tension thickening the air. A bitter silence enveloped them before he added, “You’d be wise to stay away from the doors.”

  
With Daniel’s warning igniting the fire of inquiry within him, David turned away, but the feeling of being uncoupled from reality gnawed at him. Evie, Bernie, and now Daniel—all of them entangled in a web thick with foreboding. As he stepped back into the corridor, David spotted Art, his colleague, standing idle at the edge of a long hallway, his head tilted toward something only he could hear.

Curiosity tugged at David’s instincts. He approached, noticing Art’s lips moving almost rhythmically, soft hisses spilling into the emptiness. “*Cracks remember,*” Art murmured to the wall, conviction lacing his tone. David hesitated, stepping closer to eavesdrop.

“What are you doing?” David finally asked, breaking the spell of solitude that enveloped Art.

Art turned toward him, a fleeting moment of surprise flickering in his expression before he laughed dismissively. “Just talking to the walls. They’ve seen more than you know.”

David’s unease deepened. “What do you mean?”

“Every crack, every chipped paint, they remember—moments lost, lives forgotten.” Art waved a hand in mock grandiosity. “*You should try it. Maybe they’ll tell you things you never knew.*” 

David held his stare, a battle of doubts and revelations playing out in his head. “You can’t be serious.”

Art shrugged, his casual demeanor masking the encroaching darkness. “Doesn’t matter what I say. The building talks to those who listen. Just be careful. Or you might end up like them.”

  
Art’s words hung in the air after he walked away, their weight anchoring David’s thoughts. It was a simple caution, yet it echoed ominously, compelling him to confront the secrets buried in the heart of the structure. As he navigated the winding corridors, each turn threatened to engulf him in a dimension of madness. 

Then he heard the scraping sound, a horrible grind that slid an icy shiver down his spine. He tracked the noise, stepping cautiously toward the sound, which led him to a massive door half hidden away in the shadows. It loomed before him, a gaping maw that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. He remembered the words of those who had come before him. What would happen if he crossed that threshold?

Before he could wrestle with the decision, the door creaked open, revealing a space bathed in darkness. Something instinctual inside him urged retreat, but curiosity warred with fear. What waited beyond? 

Then he saw Walter, one of the more seasoned carpenters, stepping into the void, his form swallowed in an instant by the dark. David blinked, a surge of disbelief coursing through him. The corridor remained unchanged, unaware, indifferent to Walter’s disappearance. David felt the isolation draw closer, wrapping around him like a gossamer of despair.

“Walter!” he shouted, but it echoed back, an unanswered cry drowned in silence. He wanted to chase after him, to shout, to demand answers, but he was paralyzed, a spectator to the grotesque theater unfolding before him. 

Just like that, Walter was gone, the door now firmly shut. David's heart raced erratically; anger and horror twisted together inside him. The building had a nervous energy that danced maliciously, lighting up the room with flashes of dread.

  
Gritting his teeth, David turned from the door, yearning to grasp reality again. The laughter of Art replayed in his mind, now laced with a sinister edge. “*They’ll remember you too,*” he could almost hear him say. The emotions spiraled—a jumble of rage, confusion, and dread.

He made his way back through the echoing hallways, desperate to find a tether to normalcy, seeking solace in familiar faces, feeling lost in a maze of fear. The memory of Walter haunted him, woven into the fabric of the building. The air hung thick with an ominous charge as David began to realize that he was racing against time itself. 

He needed to confront the mystery, to understand the warnings that consumed him in whispers from the past. He found himself once again in the break room with Daniel, who looked up and met his gaze. The weight of their shared silence spoke volumes.

“They’re disappearing all around us,” David hissed, his frustration spilling over. “Everyone just vanishes, and no one cares! What are we supposed to do?”

Daniel’s expression turned grave, shadows deepening in the hollows of his eyes. “You have to listen—follow the cycles. Learn from it.” David wanted to protest, to refute the bleakness of it all, but Daniel’s tone brooked no argument. “The building calls, but you can’t let it trap you, or else you’ll become part of its story.”

“What do you mean by cycles?” David asked, trying to untangle the disarray in his mind.

“People come and go, but it never changes,” Daniel replied. “The same horrors repeat. The doors are liars. They’ll grant you passage… when you’re not ready, they’ll hold you hostage, or worse, ensnare you forever.”

  
Clenching his fists, David felt the truth cloaked in fear. The exodus of souls masquerading as a routine left scars deeper than the wood beneath his hands. He glanced at the walls, half-expecting them to whisper back at him. The unnerving encounter with Art replayed, and a desperate need to decode the cryptic nature of this structure engulfed him completely. 

He left the break room with purpose, traversing the hallways that felt both familiar and foreign. He needed to discover a way to break the cycle, to save not only himself but also Walter and those before him. Burdened with an unsettling resolve, he made his way toward the ominous door that had claimed Walter. 

Gathering his courage, he stood before it. With a deep breath, he reached for the knob, a cold tremor coursing through him. The metallic surface felt wrong, as if charged with an electric buzz that threatened to pull him in. He hesitated, his fingers hovering. Evie’s warning seeped back into his memory—no one sought out those who vanished. Yet, a defiance sparked within him, urging him to explore the unknown.

He twisted the knob, pushing the door open wider this time. Darkness beyond beckoned, a depth that seemed sentient, alive with whispers of the past. Stepping through felt like walking into a void, disconnected from light and time. His heart thundered, each beat a countdown. 

“Walter!” he called out into the chasm. The sound bounced back, a hollow, mocking echo that sent a shiver down his spine, warning him of the futility of his call.

  
He stepped deeper into the darkness, the air thickening. Echoes surrounded him, fragments of voices colliding, their stories merging into a cacophony that clawed at his mind. The whispers morphed into a chant, hauntingly rhythmic, each syllable dripping with desperation. “*Help us… remember us… don’t forget us…*”

David’s pace quickened, a primal fear igniting his instincts. He heard something crack underfoot, his gaze snapping down to a severed piece of wood—a remnant of another craftsman, lost to the depths of the building. Panic took hold; every fleeting sound screamed of danger. The walls pulsed with the energy of countless forgotten souls, each echoing their tales of woe.

“*Why were you all just waiting?*” he screamed into the void, the mouth of despair swallowing his words. An overwhelming sadness enveloped him, the realization that they had all succumbed to the treacherous dance of inevitability. 

The darkness felt alive around him, murmuring secrets he couldn’t decipher. He ventured further, a flicker of resolve igniting within him against the encroaching tendrils of despair. Walter was here, somewhere in this web of forgotten souls. He would find him, break this damn cycle, or at the very least, confront it head-on. 

Struggling against rising terror, David pressed forward, each step amplifying the confusion swirling in the shadows. 

  
And then he saw it—the faint outline of a figure outlined against an impossibly dark backdrop. David’s heart raced as he recognized the familiar silhouette, desperate hope wrapping around him like a warm blanket in the chill of despair. “Walter!” he shouted, feeling the primal urge to reach out.

The figure turned slowly, revealing a face emblazoned with the anguish of forgotten dreams. Walter’s eyes met David’s, but they were empty, hollow voids that spoke of despair. “You shouldn’t have come here,” Walter whispered, his voice a mere sigh blending with the shadows. “You can’t save us.”

“What… what happened?” David asked, trembling, the enormity of the moment crashing over him. “We need to escape!”

“It’s the building,” Walter replied, collapsing into a heap against the wall. “It holds us. It feeds on our fear and desperation. The more you fight, the more it tightens its grip. You might as well accept it.”

“No!” David’s resolve hardened. “I refuse to be part of this! I won’t let myself or anyone else be trapped here like you.” 

Walter’s laughter escaped, brittle and broken, spiraling into the air. “It isn’t about choice, David. The building decides who stays and who goes.”

As the shadows closed in, David realized the cycle must end here. He would not surrender to despair. Rather than retreating, he needed to confront his own past, the regrets that had haunted him before stepping into this twisted reality. Holding Walter’s stare, he breathed deep. 

“*I’m not done fighting.*” David declared, a surge of defiance swelling within him. The whispering chorus resonated more intensely now, a chaotic symphony that roared to life as he prepared for the battle against the cycles that enslaved them. 

In that moment, he understood. The cycle would continue unless he broke it. Through sheer will, he would defy the whispers, challenge the emptiness, and forge a path toward freedom—not just for himself, but for all those the building had suffocated into silence. David’s resolve intensified, igniting a fire in his chest that had long been snuffed out by relentless despair. The dim glow of flickering lights strained to illuminate Walter’s face, casting shadows that danced with trepidation. He rose from the cracked floor, each creak of the wood beneath him echoing through the hollow corridors like a specter of his past, but he didn’t waver. 

“*What are you planning to do?*” Walter’s voice trembled slightly, betraying the veil of confidence he tried to maintain. 

“*I need to confront them... the ones who did this,*” David said, a steely determination weaving through his quiet words. “*Their shadows haunt us, Walter. I can feel them everywhere—watching, waiting. But they never expected us to fight back.*”

For a brief moment, Walter hesitated, the weight of doubt palpable in the air between them. “*You think you’re strong enough? You think we can break free from this?*”

“*I know we can,*” David replied, and he stepped closer to Walter, his voice a whisper that tilted toward urgency. “*Together, we’re stronger than they ever imagined. But I can’t do this alone.*”

Walter searched David’s eyes for the flicker of hope that had ignited his own spirit. In that instant, reluctance faded. “*Then let’s do it. But where do we start?*”

David squared his shoulders, the faint heartbeat of the building underscoring their alliance. “*We need to get to the heart of this place. The source of the whispers.*”

The building loomed ominously overhead, its architecture twisted and warped like minds trapped within it. Walls pulsed with dark energy, alive with memories and regrets—the tangible essence of the souls who had succumbed to despair. David felt their presence curling like smoke through the air, each breath whispering tales of sorrow and fruitless dreams.

He turned away from Walter and took a step into the hallway, feeling the air shift around him. The whispers grew louder, intertwining with his own thoughts. *You cannot win. You will only be consumed.*

“*Push through it,*” he reminded himself, shaking off the oppressive weight of negativity. He focused on the path ahead, a narrow corridor that stretched into darkness. 

Walter fell in step beside him, a hesitant but steady presence. “*What if we don’t find a way out? What if they just lead us to more shadows?*” 

“*Then we’ll face them,*” David replied, swallowing the creeping doubt that threatened to rise. “*If they wanted us to cower, they wouldn’t have let us get this far.*”

They pressed on, each step stirring the echoes of past failures, the shadows thickening around them. The hall twisted and turned, each bend revealing doors adorned with thick chains, bindings that mocked their plight. David understood then that each door represented a person—a story, a life, a choice that had led them to this cursed realm. 

Suddenly, a scraping sound drew their attention, and David caught sight of a door slightly ajar down the corridor. He exchanged a glance with Walter, who nodded quietly. Their unspoken agreement propelled them forward, with David's heart pounding in tandem to the growing cacophony of whispered despair.

With a deep breath, David pushed the door open. It creaked eerily, the hinges protesting their intrusion. Inside, the room was dimly lit, elaborate patterns of light and shadow intertwining across surfaces like a predator's web. A solitary figure sat amidst the darkness, hunched over a weathered desk piled high with sheets of fragmented memories.

“*Welcome,*” the figure purred, a voice smooth yet dripping with malice. David’s stomach churned.

“*Who are you?*” David found himself whispering, as if the intrusion required him to tread lightly.

“*I am the Keeper of Lost Souls,*” the figure declared, straightening. Faced with an unassuming countenance—a neatly trimmed beard, sharp eyes—this entity radiated an unsettling aura. “*Here, I collect remnants of despair, fragments of choices unrepaired.*”

“*Let them go,*” David demanded, a boldness rising within him. “*You have no right to hold them.*”

The Keeper chuckled lightly, an eerie sound that echoed through the chamber, bouncing off the walls like a trapped bird. “*Ah, but you see, those choices are not mine to give or take. They are bound by their own making and have chosen to remain.*”

David clenched his fists, anger blurring his vision momentarily. “*Why do you do this? What is your purpose?*”

“*Purpose?*” The Keeper leaned forward, the shadows wrapping tighter around him. “*I am merely a chronicler of sorrow, an observer of the cycle of despair. I offer them a chance to live again—albeit not in the way you wish.*”

Through the dimness, David caught sight of faces—spectral visages flickering within the shadows cast by the Keeper's semblance. They reached out, lips moving in silent screams. 

“*No,*” David breathed, stepping back. “*You’re not offering them a chance at all. You’re binding them to their pain!*”

“*Pain is an essential element of existence,*” the Keeper replied with an inflection of mockery. “*Without it, they are incomplete, devoid of the experience that defines them. Besides, who would you be without your scars? Would you fight as fiercely in a world without darkness?*”

“*Perhaps,*” Walter interjected, emboldened by David’s defiance. “*But they should have the choice to Of course! Please provide the sentence you'd like me to finish.
