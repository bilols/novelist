# Chapter 01 – Arrival

  
Jack Morris stepped onto the cracked sidewalk leading to the apartment building, a sense of foreboding wrapping around him like a heavy fog. The towering structure loomed overhead, its peeling paint and broken windows inviting doubts that whispered in the back of his mind. With a deep breath, he pushed the door open, the creak echoing through the musty entryway. The faint smell of mildew wafted around him, and he reminded himself that he was here to start anew, to breathe life into this neglected place. 

As he crossed the threshold, he spotted Art Grayson, the building's superintendent, leaning against a wall with an air of disinterest. Art looked more like a transient than a caretaker – his clothes wrinkled and gray hair tousled. “You must be Jack,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “I’ve got a key to your unit.” 

Following Art deeper into the building, Jack couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The dimly lit hallway felt stifling, as if the walls were closing in around him. Art spoke monotonously, detailing repairs and renovations with a distanced professionalism that failed to mask the unsettling silence surrounding them. 

“Here’s your place,” Art said as they reached the door. He shrugged, an unconcerned gesture that did little to ease Jack’s growing nervousness. Although the apartment needed extensive work, Jack couldn’t ignore the prickling awareness that settled in his stomach. Before he could dwell on it, Art’s voice cut through the haze. “Any questions? Just knock on my door.” 

Jack gave a curt nod, dismissing the doubts tightening in his chest. He sensed Art’s reluctance to engage further and decided it was time to focus on the task ahead.

After settling in, Jack stepped outside for a breath of fresh air. The sky had turned a thick slate gray, promising an impending storm. He wandered toward the common area, where he spotted Evie, the visiting nurse, leaning against the brick wall, her warm gaze piercing through the gloom like a blade.

“Ah, the new tenant,” she said, offering him a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “You’re going to want to be careful here.”

Jack raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Careful? Is it really that bad?” He tried to laugh it off, the tension in his muscles tightening as he thought of her warning. 

Evie leaned in conspiratorially. “Watch the clock,” she whispered, her tone grave. The words sent a chill skittering across the nape of his neck. 

“Watch the clock?” he echoed, puzzled. He glanced around, as if searching for an explanation among the peeling wallpaper and faded memories of the building. 

She shrugged, stepping back. “You’ll see. Just… keep your eyes open.” 

Before Jack could ask more questions, she turned and disappeared down the shadowy hallway. He stood there, staring at the spot where she’d just been. He dismissed her warning, telling himself it was just nerves—the kind that always struck in a new place. What did he have to worry about? Yet, the oddity of her words lingered, reverberating in the back of his mind like a haunting refrain.

In the following days, Jack threw himself into his work, tearing down rotting drywall and hauling debris into the hall. The apartment felt increasingly like a shell, waiting for him to breathe life back into it. As he wielded his tools, however, a strange scraping noise began to echo behind the walls, a sound that gnawed at his concentration. 

At first, he attributed it to the age of the building—the settling of wood or perhaps the scurrying of rodents. But the sound was distinct, regular, and almost deliberate, sending cold shivers through his bones. “Hey, Art?” Jack called out, wiping the sweat from his brow as he stepped out onto the landing. 

Art looked up from his newspaper, irritation flickering in his eyes. “What is it?” 

“Have you heard those noises? There’s something scratching in the walls. It’s… unsettling.” Jack rubbed the back of his neck, trying to shake off the unease rippling through him. 

“Everything’s normal,” Art replied flatly, dismissing him with a wave. “This building is old. You’re just getting used to it.” 

Jack bit his lip, holding back the wave of frustration that rose within him. He glanced around, eyes darting from the flickering overhead lights to the edges of the peeling wallpaper. He had hoped for some reassurance, but Art’s indifference only deepened his sense of isolation and fear.

Later that evening, while cleaning up in the fading light of day, Jack met Mrs. Agnes Holloway, a resident who seemed to materialize out of nowhere. She was an elderly woman with silver hair wispy like a cloud, her eyes sparkling with a restless energy that made Jack wary. 

“You’re the new carpenter, aren’t you?” she asked, her voice crackling like the leaves underfoot. Jack nodded, unsure of what to expect from her. 

“Make sure you do your work right,” she chattered on. “I knew a carpenter once. He vanished, you know.” 

Jack’s brow furrowed. “Vanished?” 

Mrs. Holloway nodded solemnly, leaning in closer. “Yes, a long time ago. He was fixing up a different unit when… poof, gone, just like that.” 

“Just like that?” Jack repeated, fighting back the creeping unease. What could have possibly happened? 

“Last I heard, he was looking at a certain doorway. It whispered to him, they say. Then he disappeared. No one ever found a trace.” Her voice dropped, tinged with both excitement and fear. “People believe it was the doorway that took him.” 

Jack shifted under her gaze, heart racing. It sounded like a ghost story, one designed to keep children awake at night. Yet her expression bore a seriousness that unknotted his insides. “I’ll remember to steer clear of any whispering doorways,” he said, half-joking, but even he knew there was a sliver of truth in her words tethered to a deeper dread. 

✔ 

  
Later that night, Jack lay in bed further haunted by Mrs. Holloway’s tale. Muffled memories of Evie’s warning echoed in his thoughts. As his eyes struggled to adjust to the shadows, he heard it again—the scraping sound. It began as a faint whisper, building in intensity, seeming to claw at the walls, a desperate plea for attention. 

“Maybe it’s just the pipes,” he muttered to himself, curling deeper under the covers as though they could protect him from whatever was lurking beyond. Yet, the remnants of Mrs. Holloway’s story clung to the edges of his mind, and he found it increasingly difficult to dismiss the thought that the building was alive in some twisted, dark way. 

No sooner had he begun to drift off than the noise grew louder, a relentless rasping that sent jolts of adrenaline through him. He threw the blanket aside and padded quietly to the short hallway, tracing the source of the sound with his heart thrumming against his chest.

It came from behind the walls, intertwining with the night, a scratching, a desperate whisper demanding to be heard. He froze, breath caught in his throat. He wanted to flee back to his room, to drown the sinister noise in the comforting imagined safety of sleep. But destiny held him, anchoring his feet in place. 

Suddenly, a loud crack interrupted the noise, causing him to jump back. Before he could process what had happened, he heard the unmistakable sound of a door opening and closing, followed by a guttural murmur that echoed down the hall.

Jack stood paralyzed, the blood rushing in his ears. Heart racing, he stumbled backward toward his room, convinced he had crossed some invisible line between reality and nightmare. As dawn approached, Jack resolved to dismiss the encounter as fatigue—after all, loss of sleep could induce many things: hallucinations, paranoia, and more. But deep down, he felt a gnawing instinct telling him otherwise. 

The next day, the sun shone through the dingy windows, illuminating dust particles in the air that danced like lost spirits. With a renewed sense of purpose, Jack set out to focus on his renovations, hoping to banish the shadows lingering in the corners of his mind. 

But as the hours ticked by, the noises returned, slithering through the walls, taunting him ear by ear. Desperation built as he repeated his tasks, but Jack’s focus fractured each time the fear clawed its way back into his thoughts. 

“Art?” Jack called hesitantly, leaning against the wall where the sound seemed most pronounced. “Can we talk?” 

Art appeared, scowling, flicking the last of his cigarette. “You got something to say? Make it quick." 

“There’s something in the walls. I swear I keep hearing it.” 

“Look, Jack,” Art said, crossing his arms. “These buildings make noise. You need to get used to it. It’s just old wood, old pipes. Nothing to lose sleep over.” 

“Nothing to lose sleep over?” Jack pressed, frustration bubbling in his chest. But Art had already retreated, leaving Jack alone in his thoughts again—the sounds sharpening into a relentless chorus, mockingly echoing in his ears.

The following evening, after another long day of plastering and painting, Jack ventured out again for some much-needed air. He crossed paths with Evie in the common area, where she seemed absorbed in her own thoughts. When she spotted him, her eyes brightened momentarily before dimming.

“Everything okay?” she asked, tilting her head slightly, as if assessing more than just his answer.

Jack hesitated, grappling for words. “I keep hearing that noise from the walls. It’s getting louder. I think something's… wrong.”

Evie’s face tensed, a flicker of concern passing over her features. “You should be careful. Sometimes… things aren’t what they seem.” 

Her cryptic response made Jack’s stomach drop. “What do you mean?” 

She took a step closer, lowering her voice. “You need to remember the clock,” she warned, biting her lower lip, and glancing towards the stairwell as if expecting someone to emerge from the shadows. “Just… be vigilant, Jack. Not everything in this building wants your well-being.” 

After she turned and drifted away, Jack felt more lost than ever. Shadows converged around him, and the gnawing sounds mingled with the whispers that seemed to emerge from every corner. What in the world had he stumbled into? 

He battled his growing paranoia but could not escape the inkling of dread that settled in his heart. He could almost feel the pulse of the building beneath him, a heartbeat echoing in sync with his own.

Determined to confront the uncertainty, Jack returned to his apartment and equipped himself with a flashlight before creeping through the labyrinth of hallways. Adrenaline raced through his veins. As he turned onto a darker section of the building, a semblance of courage pressed him onward. 

He paused outside what appeared to be the unit next door. The sound intensified, clawing at the edges of his sanity. Jack steadied himself and knocked, heart pounding against his ribcage. No response came, only the scraping spiraled around him, growing frantic, almost synchronized with his rising heartbeat. 

Steeling himself, Jack turned the knob to the vacant unit and pushed the door open. Darkness enveloped him, but he pressed on, the beam of his flashlight slicing through the blackness as he ventured deeper inside. Dust motes floated in the light, and he felt a tingle of apprehension crawling up his spine. 

He moved cautiously, scanning every crevice, every corner, the scratching sounds now a disorienting lullaby in the eerie silence. Then unexpectedly, he stumbled upon a narrow wooden door wedged between the wall in the back corner, half-hidden from sight. 

The scraping crescendoed, almost beckoning him closer, igniting the curiosity that had plagued him since he entered. The door appeared unremarkable, but the air around it pulsated ominously, as if it held secrets that begged to be uncovered. 

“Just a doorway," he whispered, half-reassured but still uncertain. “…just a doorway.” 

As he reached for the knob, panic surged. What lay hidden behind it? Would it echo the truth of the carpenter's fate? The pulse of the building broke the stillness, and Jack felt the weight of its unrelenting gaze bore down upon him. With a shuddering breath, he braced himself to confront whatever lingered beyond the door, the clock ticking silently in the back of his mind. 

✔ Jack closed his eyes for a fleeting moment, steeling himself against a wave of apprehension. He could almost hear the faint whisper of the wind curling through the cracks of the aging structure, like the soft murmurs of long-lost souls trapped within its walls. “Just a doorway,” he repeated, this time with a sense of purpose kindling in his chest. He wrapped his fingers around the cool metal knob, feeling its weight, its chill, and pushed it open.

The door creaked, and a palpable wave of cold air washed over him, wrapping around him like a shroud. Through the darkness that loomed beyond, a tapestry of shadows danced erratically, revealing glimpses of an unfinished space. Hesitating at the threshold, he peered inside. The room was cavernous, far bigger than he had anticipated, with high ceilings that seemed to vanish into impenetrable darkness. The faint outline of walls emerged as his eyes adjusted, but the air was thick with a musty scent that made his throat scratch.

With one last glance at the safety of the hallway, Jack stepped across the threshold. The sensation sent a shiver up his spine as if the house itself had drawn him in, sealing the door behind him in metaphorical chains. Dust motes floated lazily in the slivers of muted light that struggled to penetrate the gloom. He caught sight of scattered debris, old furniture draped in white sheets that fluttered softly in a draft, and something more—something that felt alive.

He took a tentative step forward, his foot crunching on glass and wood splinters strewn across the floor. The room felt heavy with stories long forgotten, each creak of the floor letting out a fragile sigh that whispered secrets of years past. His heart raced, an echo of the long-buried fears he had hoped to escape since the day he found that journal—the carpenter's journal. Each page had drawn him deeper into an obsession, detailing the architect’s visions for this very house. He could sense the depths of ambition that had once thrived here, only to succumb to decay.

The walls were lined with faded pictures, their frames broken and dangling, some appearing to be spectral figures caught in time. A chill brushed against the nape of his neck as he stepped closer to examine one portrait. It depicted a man with piercing eyes—a reflection of the very essence he felt lingering in the dim recesses of the room. “Who are you?” he murmured as if addressing the very air, but the room responded only with silence.

Scooping dust off a nearby surface, Jack uncovered a small, forgotten table—a workbench, perhaps, where the carpenter had pored over blueprints and plans. Sprawled across its top lay scattered papers, yellowed with age, smudged ink detailing sketches of the house’s layout, elements of a structure that had been envisioned but never realized. Jack's heart raced as he recognized familiar components—rooms he had walked through without understanding their purpose, hallways that had drawn him like a moth to an ember. Each sketch illuminated his mind, igniting a resolve he had thought lost.

Yet as he rifled through the parchment, a sense of foreboding washed over him. His fingers grazed across something cold and metallic. He moved a stack of papers aside, revealing what appeared to be an old compass, its needle quivering as if disagreeing with the magnetic pull of the universe. He picked it up, feeling the weight of it settle in his palm—a stark contrast to the ephemeral nature of the sketches surrounding him. 

As he turned the compass in his hand, a sharp draft swirled around the room. Jack’s breath quickened at the sudden shift in the atmosphere. The dust danced violently, shadows twisting like fingers beneath the flickering light that seemed to pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat. Was the old house alive, responding to him? Where was the line between curiosity and danger?

He shoved the compass into his pocket, whispering a silent prayer, convinced that he was being watched. “I need to understand,” he said aloud, trying to dispel the dread that was creeping into his mind. He was no stranger to ghosts; the carpenter’s work haunted him, the sorrow etched into the very structure that had been erected with such promise. Perhaps understanding the history could liberate him from the burden of this secret.

The low light drew him further into the room—each step revealing more troubling remnants of fractured dreams. A staircase wound its way upward, its banister splintered with neglect. Swallowing hard, he took one careful step after another, the wood moaning beneath his weight.

As he ascended, the darkness thickened, and he felt as though he was moving through a curtain of shadows. At the top, a long corridor stretched before him, lined with doors, each closed and silent, but their presence unnerving. Jack paused, shoving his trembling hands into his pockets. Unlike the inviting chaos of the workbench, this hallway felt sinister, as if the very air was charged with unspoken memories.

He approached the first door, feeling the hem of fate tugging at his heels. With trembling fingers, he turned the knob. The door swung open, revealing a small room obscured by a haze of dust and cobwebs. An old cot lay against the wall, remnants of someone’s personal sanctuary. A few dead plants in terracotta pots marked forgotten promises of life, but the air held the musty scent of desolation.

Peeking into the ephemeral air, he spotted a journal sitting on a small, rickety table—a mirror to his own obsession. Jack crossed the threshold cautiously, the floor creaking underfoot. He swept the dust away and opened the cover. Most pages were blank, but a few scrawled entries caught his eye, each a fleeting glimpse into the life of someone locked within Of course!
