# Strunk & White Cheat Sheet for Modern Fiction

| Section | Core Take-away | Quick-reference Tips |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **1. Elementary Rules of Usage** | Keep mechanics invisible so the story shines. | • **Possessives:** singular nouns end in *’s* (`the boss’s temper`).<br>• **Commas:** use after each item in a series (`red, white, and blue`).<br>• **Pronoun-antecedent:** each pronoun should clearly point to one noun. |
| **2. Elementary Principles of Composition** | Structure for flow and force. | • **Paragraphs:** new idea = new paragraph.<br>• **Emphasis:** put the key phrase at the end of the sentence/paragraph.<br>• **Tense:** stay in one tense per scene unless a time-shift is obvious. |
| **3. A Few Matters of Form** | Polish without drawing attention. | • **Dialog tags:** stick to *said* or *asked*; let action lines carry emotion.<br>• **Numbers:** spell out one-nine, use figures for 10+.<br>• **Titles of works:** *italics* for books, “quotes” for stories or chapters. |
| **4. Words & Expressions Commonly Misused** | Clarity beats decoration. | • *That* vs. *which*: **that** for essential clauses, **which** for optional.<br>• *Comprise* (whole comprises parts) vs. *compose* (parts compose whole).<br>• Skip fog words (*very, really, basically, currently*). |
| **5. An Approach to Style** | Voice is choice—choose on purpose. | • **Active voice:** “She slammed the door” vs. “The door was slammed.”<br>• **Omit needless words:** if it doesn’t deepen character, scene, or meaning—cut it.<br>• **Be specific:** trade *thing* for *pocketknife*, *walked* for *ambled*—but vary with restraint. |
| **6. Rhythm & Variety (Modern Tweaks)** | Move the camera; change the beat. | • Mix short punchy sentences with longer reflective ones.<br>• Break a rule **deliberately** when the effect justifies it.<br>• Let paragraph length mirror tension: tight for action, roomy for reflection. |
| **7. Dialogue & Interior Monologue** | Sound natural, read clean. | • Real speech is rhythmic, not grammatically perfect.<br>• Drop filler (*uh, like, you know*) unless it shows character.<br>• Italicize interior thoughts sparingly. |
| **8. Scene Hygiene** | Help readers see and hear, not wrestle. | • Anchor scenes with a quick sensory cue (light, smell, temperature).<br>• Keep viewpoint consistent; head-hops break immersion.<br>• Mark time jumps clearly (“Three days later”). |
| **9. Common Quick Fixes** | Fast edits that tighten pages. | • Delete every *that*; restore only what’s needed for sense.<br>• Swap *was -ing* for simple past (*was walking → walked*) unless duration matters.<br>• Read dialogue aloud; trim anything stagey. |
| **10. Revision Checklist (pre-send)** | Final pass in under five minutes. | ☐ Scene goal clear? ☐ POV steady? ☐ Active verbs dominate? ☐ No dangling pronouns? ☐ Extra words trimmed? ☐ One vivid detail per scene? |

## How to Use This Sheet

1. **Draft freely.** Let the story spill before policing it.  
2. **Run scenes through the checklist.** Catch passive verbs, mixed tenses, and flab.  
3. **Scan “Words Misused” & “Quick Fixes.”** They cure most bloat in minutes.  
4. **Break rules only on purpose.** A strategic fragment or run-on can mimic breathless thought—just don’t turn every line into a stunt.

*Pin it by your desk, keep writing, and let the craft vanish so the story sticks.*
