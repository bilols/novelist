# Chapter 06 – The Final Threshold

  
Jack stood still, adrenaline coursing through his veins as he scanned the hallway. The echo of their united voices still lingered in his mind, a haunting harmony pushed against the weight of fear. He stepped forward, the lights flickering overhead, a cacophony of whispers brushing against his ears, murmurs of his own thoughts spiraling out of control. *Where do I go?*  
Every door he approached felt like a mocking gesture, the handles cold and unyielding. As he opened each, the world beyond revealed only another iteration of the hallway he had just left. The mismatched patterns of the carpet twisted together like the thoughts in his head. The certainty of his previous resolve slowly unraveled; *he was trapped*. Panic clawed at the edges of his sanity, the surreal nature of the situation suffocating him. He turned, searching for an escape, his breaths quickening as the realization gripped him tighter than any chain.  
No matter how far he ran, he always returned to the spot where it all began, a loop of despair that mocked him. The walls seemed to close in, the shadows lengthening, whispering secrets he was too scared to hear. He pressed his palms against the slick surface of the wall, but the coolness offered no comfort, only a reminder of the suffocating prison he was in.  
Jack shouted, “This isn’t real! I won’t let it be!” His voice ricocheted off the walls. Yet his reflection stared back from every polished surface, a distorted echo of his desperation. The sight made his insides twist. He cursed under his breath, pacing again, each step growing heavier, each breath a reminder of his futile fight.  
Then he saw her. Evie stood at the end of the hallway, watching him with an expression that sent chills down his spine. The shadows swirled around her hair, framing her like a dark halo. She was calm, as if she'd known this was how it would play out all along. A knowing smile danced across her lips, and for a brief moment, he felt an urge to run towards her. *She’d know what to do.*  
But a different fear gripped him—one of betrayal. Did she lead him here? Did she know all along the purpose of the building? The hallway echoed with her silence, and he stumbled back against the smooth wall, helpless, entrapped by his own uncertainty.

  
“Time’s up.” Evie’s softly spoken words cut through his growing panic like a knife, each syllable a reminder of his own inadequacies. Jack’s heart sank as he registered the finality in her voice. *What did she mean?*  
He couldn’t think straight. Anger boiled up from within him. “What do you mean, *time’s up*?” His voice shook, his fists clenched hard enough to feel the skin at his knuckles stretch. "You know what’s going on here, don’t you?"  
Her expression turned serious, contradicting the earlier mirth he had seen in her eyes. “You’re going in circles, Jack. You think this place is a puzzle you can solve? It’s not. It’s a prison and you’ve been playing into its hands.”  
“Enough!” He felt his voice rise, a desperate attempt to wrestle control from her. “Tell me how to escape! Tell me it’s not too late!”  
Evie took a step closer, the distance between them cloaked in secrets and shadows. “You need to embrace what lies ahead, not fight it. Let go of the chains that bind you, Jack.”  
The words wound around him, thickened by doubt. Could he really let go? What lay ahead was an unknown that stretched like an abyss beneath him, dark and consuming. Images of the residents he fought alongside flashed before him, their faces lighting up the darkness with hope. He had to fight.  
Then the walls shuddered, a deep rumble vibrating through the floor. Jack could hardly lose himself in the cacophony of his thoughts when the building itself seemed aware of their deliberation. *What if I refuse to play by your rules?* He lashed out, the anger reflecting not only at Evie but also at the confines of the building. *Why did it hold this power?*  
Evie turned her gaze to the hallway ahead. “You have to confront the truth, Jack.” Her voice was firm, but there was an underlying sorrow. “You were never meant to escape.”  
Jack felt as though the ground opened up beneath him. *Never meant to escape*. It felt like a death sentence. “You’ve known it all this time,” he accused, a surge of rage pushing him forward. Then, his mind flicked back to their last confrontation with the light that brought them strength. They had shouted together, united. *What had he done?*  
“Did you want me to fail?” He demanded, the betrayal sharp enough to make him choke on the words.

  
Evie's eyes darkened, shadows licking at her form, but she stood resolute. “I wanted you to see it, Jack. You might still make it.”  
“But how?” The question rolled from his tongue, and anger morphed into desperation. “How do I fight something that traps me in a loop?”  
“Sometimes you must break the cycle,” she said, glancing back to the door at the end of the hallway—one he hadn’t noticed amid the chaos. “You must confront your own fear. It’s always been you, Jack.”  
Jack felt his insides twist, uncertainty battling against a growing resolve. He was tired of this place, its games, and the dread edging closer as time slipped by. “Maybe I’m too far gone.”  
“Never,” Evie replied, her voice steady. “You are stronger than you believe.” She gestured toward the ominous door, a cracked veneer barking like laughter through the hallways. “You need to smash it open.”  
The weight of her words sat heavy on his chest. Smash it open. Defiance burned in his throat as he looked back at the door. Shadows flickered and flared along its surface, watching him, waiting for him to act. But he hesitated, fear creeping back in. **What if it was a trap?**  
*What would that make me?* He had spent so long trying to free himself from the building, only to fall into its patterns of hopelessness. Tremors shook the floor beneath him.  
Then he felt it—a rush of clarity that surged through him. This was his moment. *No more holding back.* With every ounce of strength he could muster, Jack stepped toward the door, hands outstretched, ready to confront the truth that lingered behind it. The uncertainty and trepidation he’d felt began melting away, replaced by the realization that the fight carried both purpose and freedom.  

  
He launched himself forward, a kinship with loss, commitment to all who floundered against the shadows. The moment his fists connected with the door, a strange sensation coursed through his body—a unity with something larger than himself. But instead of splintering wood, he was met with resistance that felt alive.  
The door shuddered as though angry at his intrusion, the wood bleeding sawdust from the cracks that split open across its surface. Jack's heart raced in rhythm with the pulse of desperation. Each blow echoed in the corridor, a frantic drumbeat against the dark façade of the building. His muscles ached, screams of frustration clawed at his throat, but he pressed on.  
As he struck again, the room darkened around him, shadows gathering and swirling. The air was thick with the scent of sawdust, as the door reformed with every impact. Each time he thought he made progress, it slipped through his fingers like sand. The realization dawned in a painful wave. *It wouldn’t relent.*  
With every strike he delivered, the door’s resilience mocked him, the echoes of his futile attempts reverberating through his head. He staggered back, breathless from what felt like an eternity of fighting. Sweat dripped from his brow, the sound of the building’s cruel laughter ringing in his ears, drowning out the whispers of his fighting spirit.  
But inside, something ignited—a spark. Jack saw it clearly now; the futility of his struggle was also a testament to his resolve. “I won't let you win!” He shouted, charging forward once more. The darkness that suffocated him seemed to retreat slightly, as though playing with the notion of defeat.  
In one final act of sheer will, he slammed his shoulder against the door, feeling the impact shoot through his body. The wood bled once more—every splinter a part of him—and for a heartbeat, the world around him felt suspended in time. He heard the distant shatter of dreams breaking against reality, the sound soft and agonizing.  

  
When the echoes dissipated and reality returned, Jack found himself standing alone in the dark hallway, heart pounding with a rhythmic echo that felt far too loud in the polished silence. The door had reformed behind him, untouched, and the weight of despair settled once more like a heavy cloak pressing against his shoulders.  
“Did you see that?” Evie whispered from the shadows, her words trailing off into the oppressive darkness. “You fought. You tried.”  
He closed his eyes, grappling with the remnants of his struggle. “It didn’t matter,” he replied, the bitterness boiling up inside him. “It’s going to happen all over again, isn’t it?”  
“I can’t tell you that,” Evie admitted softly. “What you do next defines your path.” Her expression turned serious, and she took a step closer to him. “This is not where it ends.”  
Jack felt fatigue pulling at his limbs, urging him to succumb to despair. Yet beneath it all thrummed a determination he couldn’t shake. *He had faced the door,* but now, he felt it shift behind him, the persistent whispers swirling into clarity.  
“You know what has to happen,” Evie prompted. “The building is tenacious, but so are you.”  
The truth of her words seeped in like rays of sunlight breaking through a suffocating shroud of darkness. Jack raised his head, looking toward a distant flicker of light emanating from the end of the hallway. He inhaled deeply, pushing aside the exhaustion threatening to consume him.  
“Wait,” he said, a sudden thought piercing through the haze. “What if it doesn’t reset? What if I don’t come back next time?” The question lingered in the air, pregnant with hope and fear all at once, yet Evie's eyes bore the weight of secrets yet untold, promising a truth Jack was on the verge of grasping.

  
“Everything is a cycle here.” Evie nodded, her gaze locking him into place. “Every carpenter who walked these halls knows that truth. Their struggles echo through time like a never-ending song; pain and loss etched into the bones of the building.”  
Jack shuddered at the thought, anxiety twirling like smoke in his mind. He thought of the old man he had seen, a silhouette against a wall, trapped in faceless inertia. “So, I would be one of them,” he whispered, nauseated by the vision. “Just another ghost haunting this place, endlessly hammering at the same door?”  
“Only if you let it bind you,” Evie replied. “You’re more than just flesh and bone, more than time itself. You can set yourself free, but first... you must choose.”  
“How?” he asked, clenching his fists again. “How do I choose?”  
She stepped back, the flickering light behind her casting her in an otherworldly glow. “You have choices to make, Jack. You can either fight or resign yourself to the fate that has been laid out before you.”  
Jack's heart raced as he faced her, dread and understanding grappling in his mind. He had fought before; why should this time be any different? The cycle wasn’t about escape, it was about *acceptance*. “Evie,” he murmured, uncertainty eclipsing his every thought. “What if I fail?”  
Her eyes softened, but determination echoed in her voice. “Then you rise again. Like the very door you attacked—bleeding sawdust but refusing to shatter. You must let yourself be reborn from the ashes of every defeat.”  
He felt the weight of her words, the strength in the way she conveyed the struggle that transcended time and place. Perhaps it was true; the door had bled in response, but it had also remained standing, unbroken. Jack’s resolve swayed like a candle flickering on the edge of darkness.  
“Then I’ll rise,” he spoke, the words feeling like fire against his chest. “I won’t be bound by this cycle anymore.”  

  
With every stride toward the door, courage surged within him, redirecting the fear he had so long harbored. Each footfall resonated with purpose, anchoring him to the present while shedding the weight of his past. It was no longer about escaping; it was about confronting every shadow that sought to hold him back.  
The door loomed before him, its surface still ominous but softened by his resolve. He pressed his hand against it once more and felt a pulse beneath, mimicking the beat of his heart, thrumming with potential. This time, unlike before, he wasn’t prepared to shatter it—he intended to understand its truth, to push through its threshold.  
In that moment, he recognized the building for what it truly was—a manifestation of every fear he had ever faced. He placed both palms against the door, grounding himself against the flow of chaos threatening to consume him once more. The whispers swelled, eager to envelop him, but he pushed back.  
“I will not be afraid!” Jack shouted, the words bursting forth like a wave crashing against a mountain. The building trembled, a feral growl vibrating through the air, as shadows danced and swirled around him in defiance. He could feel the resistance shift beneath his hands, as if the door responded to his revelation.   
Slowly, he leaned into it, feeling the warmth radiate from inside. It was a perspective, not merely an escape—an acceptance of the intertwining stories that had come before him. A pinging realization struck: there were facets of his fight he had never acknowledged; struggles that bloomed in the shards of light that painted even the darkest corners.  
Jack's heart raced in reckless abandon as he pressed through the threshold, the door parting like a curtain drawn wide, unveiling truths he had been too afraid to face. Bright beams of light streamed through the opening, illuminating the figures that had walked those halls before him, etched in pain and resilience.  

  
With a final breath, he stepped into the light, not knowing where it might lead but fully embracing the choice he had made. The shadows whispered as they receded, the door falling away behind him. In that moment, it felt less like he was escaping and more like he was finally stepping into his own narrative.  
But as he turned back for just a moment, he caught sight of Evie, the smirk dancing on her lips as light glimmered in her eyes. With assurance, she spoke again, her voice now steady as a lighthouse in the night. “The cycle never truly ends, Jack. It simply evolves. You are now part of a story that can change.”  
A sudden jolt coursed through him as he looked at her one last time, seizing the significance of what she had just revealed. No longer would he be trapped in a ceaseless labyrinth of despair; instead, he could forge a new path for himself and those who came after him.  
He caught glimpses of those who had endured before—a montage of faces etched into every corner of the building. Ashamed of the emptiness he had once embraced, Jack pressed on, feeling a duty to remain vigilant Sure! Please provide the sentence you'd like me to finish.
